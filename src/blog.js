        content: `Hey y'all. This is my first blog to for this website. I want to take a moment to talk about Sky Beta. 
For around 4-5 years, I was a tester for Sky and been help reporting bugs and giving feedback. 
It was an experience I never forget. Well that and getting free cosmetics (I know most of you are here for that, don't lie to me now). Oh and portait mode in this version help with make cool videos. And the friends we make in the beta.
As sad as we are, it's time to move on. So what will happen with Sky Beta? 
1. The game has been removed from the Apple TestFlight, Google Play Store and Steam. The server are officially down. So expect the app to say unavailable.
2. The Beta Channels in the official Discord Sevrer will be closed.
3. On my end, the event links that I would use to redirect you to the game will be removed soon.
4. TGC will soon announce a Close Beta invite. You will need to fill the questionaires and sign an NDA to join the new Close Beta program. All Beta Content cannot be leak and discussions about Sky Beta can only be done in the official Discord server

For legal reason I decided not to join the Close Beta. For future official information, see the official Sky Discord server for more information.

I also got a chance to meet Nastymold in-game during her Eden Live Stream. You can see the image above.
After 4 and something years, it's time to say goodbye to Sky Beta.`,
